# Strophe Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of the Strophe Chrome Extension developed by me.

## Information Collection

The Strophe Extension does not collect any personal information from users. I do not gather, store, or transmit any data that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, or location. Since no data is collected, none of your data is sold to third parties.

## Links to Other Websites

Strophe may in future contain links to other websites not operated by me. This Privacy Policy does not cover how that website processes personal information. I encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of every website that you visit.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon commiting and pushing the new policy to the repository. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using the Strophe extension, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Strophe extension.
